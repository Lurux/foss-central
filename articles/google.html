		<div class="padding">
			Google is legally forced to give users some control over the data it collects. The first thing to do if you're forced to use Google services is to look at you Google <a class="hover" href="https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy dashboard.</a> Here are some of the things you can turn off:
		</div>
		<ul style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
			<li class="padding">
				Web activity
			</li>
			<li class="padding">
				Location history
			</li>
			<li class="padding">
				Personalized ads
			</li>
			<li class="padding">
				Activity from other Google services
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="padding">
			It is worth noting that, while you will be able to control some of your data here, there are unfortunately still some services you won't be able to disable, and some residual data that you may not be able to remove from your account.

			<b>Tweak Android settings</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			Although Android is a threat to your privacy, there are several settings you can disable to mitigate what data gets sent to Google. In your Android settings, toggle the following:
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			<b>Location services</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			Overall, it is always a good practice to disable location services when you don't use them. Moreover, you may want to disable bluetooth and wifi scanning on your device: this might make location slightly less precise, but will improve your privacy when using it. To do that, head over to <span class="bold">Location → ≡ Scanning</span>, and toggle off wifi and bluetooth scanning.
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			<b>Advertising and diagnostics</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			 By default, your user has a unique advertising ID that can be used to track you, and sends Android usage data to Google. Head over to <span class="bold">Google → Ads</span> to disable the first one, and <span class="bold">Google → ≡ Usage and diagnostics</span> for the second.
		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="section">
		<div class="padding title">
			<b>Disable synchronization</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			By default, a lot of data is synchronized to your Google account, including notes, contacts, agenda, and a lot more. If you're not interested in Google cloud services, you can opt out of this in <span class="bold">Accounts → Google</span> by disabling synchronization or fine-tuning what gets sent to the cloud. You can also remove the account altogether !
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			Moreover, automatic backup to Google cloud may be enabled on some devices. If you don't want to do that, head over to <span class="bold">Backup and restore</span> to disable the option.
		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="section">
		<div class="padding title">
			<b>Apps</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			This one is really basic and should be common sense by now, but I'll repeat it just in case. This is not related to Android itself, but the apps installed on it: if an app forces you to accept giving it odd permissions that shouldn't be required for it to function, <span class="bold">do not use it.</span> This include pre-installed apps, that can often be replaced by more privacy-focused ones when needed. You can always check and edit your app permissions in the <span class="bold">Applications</span> section of the settings.
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			In this section, you'll also be able to remove unused applications, and disable system apps that you can't uninstall if you don't use them.
