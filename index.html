			We live in a world where big corporations know more and more about you. They actually know so much about you that they can make you buy what you don't want to buy, believe what they want you to believe, and influence your vote in presidential elections. Don't want to be part of this ? This website will help you build a free digital life. <a class="hover" href="ressources.html">Jump to ressources page.</a>

			Remember when you post something on the net, anyone can copy it, edit it, and cherry-pick the information to make you look like a criminal. This includes hackers, foes, and any current or future governments who may have bad intentions. Even if everything you do is legal, being part of a particular social or ethnic class may be used against you in the future. <a class="hover" href="https://whyprivacymatters.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more.</a>

			❝Saying that you don't need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is to assume that no one should have, or could have, to hide anything - including their immigration status, unemployment history, financial history, and health records. You're assuming that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about their religious beliefs, political affiliations, and sexual activities, as casually as some choose to reveal their movie and music tastes and reading preferences.❞
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			❝Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. Or that you don't care about freedom of the press because you don't like to read. Or that you don't care about freedom of religion because you don't believe in God. Or that you don't care about the freedom to peaceably assemble because you're a lazy, antisocial agoraphobic.❞

			For example, by using Windows, you give Microsoft a ton of information about you - including access to your files, browsing history, as well as your microphone, camera, typing history, and much more...

			<b>What does open-source have to do with this ?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			When a piece of software is open-source, anyone can see its source code, propose new features or submit security fixes, and edit it to make their own version. Here's why this is interesting:
		</div>
		<ul style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
			<li class="padding">
				If the creators of a project or a malicious person try to sneak in bad features to collect or misuse user data, people will be able to see it, and either correct it or spread the word.
			</li>
			<li class="padding">
				Because so many persons are watching the source code, big open-source projects are usually very secure. Do note there may be exceptions to that, especially with smaller project with a little community.
			</li>
			<li class="padding">
				Finally, because of their ideology, open-source projects will usually tend to listen and give a lot of freedom to their users. Since anyone can make their own version, open-source projects have a big incentive to please their community, which is why so many of them are actually community-driven.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="padding">
			In the end, open-source projects are an excellent way to get better products, defending their user's rights, privacy and digital freedom. While all open-source projects may not be perfect, they usually are a good guarantee of quality and security. <a class="hover" href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more.</a>

			<b>What about Linux ?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			Linux is an open-source operating system - the piece of software that is responsible for your computer to work. Because it is open-source, Linux is very secure, and respects user's privacy. Contrary to Windows and Mac OS, Linux does not collect <span class="bold">any</span> user data.
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			On top of that, Linux has many other advantages; for example, it very fast, stable, and allows you to customize it the way you want by changing components like its user interface. Finally, Linux is also free, and can usually be tested using a simple USB stick !
		</div>
		<div class="padding">
			Oh, I almost forgot. Because Linux comes in so many variations called "distributions", it is possible to find a version that will fit very specific needs, like doing security testing or scientific research - or just reviving very, very old computers. <a class="hover" href="https://librehunt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover.</a>
